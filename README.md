## About
Dyslexia is a medical condition, in which, the individual is unable to comprehend complex learning patterns or even the simple ones.
It is a learning disorder that involves difficulty in reading, and problems identifying the relation of letters and words.
It must be kept in mind that dyslexia is not due to intelligence, hearing or vision. Most studies showed that children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.
There is **NO CURE** for dyslexia as isn't often recognized till the adulthood, where it would be too late by then to seek help.

**LexiScan**, a platform to pre-diagnose dyslexia, can help children from the age-group of 3-11. It aims to provide accurate diagnosis to detect dyslexia, without the repeated appointments of the doctors. We, as 
a platform, aim to help doctors as well as the children help diagnose symptomps of dyslexia efficiently. The diagnose is based on active and passive tests, which includes **Questionnaire** and **EEG readings**
from the brain.
